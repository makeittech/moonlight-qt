# GitHub Actions Build Fixes Summary

## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Runtime Version Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The Flatpak manifest specified runtime version `23.08`, but the build script was trying to install version `6.5`.

**Files Fixed**:
- `scripts/build-steamdeck-flatpak.sh` (Line 83)
- Changed from: `org.kde.Platform//6.5 org.kde.Sdk//6.5`
- Changed to: `org.kde.Platform//23.08 org.kde.Sdk//23.08`

### 2. **Missing REF Parameter in flatpak remote-info** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The `flatpak remote-info` command requires a REF parameter but was missing it.

**Files Fixed**:
- `.github/workflows/test-build.yml` (Line 38)
- `.github/workflows/build-steamdeck-flatpak.yml` (Line 55)
- Changed from: `flatpak --user remote-info flathub org.kde.Platform`
- Changed to: `flatpak --user remote-info flathub org.kde.Platform//23.08`

### 3. **Missing Submodule Initialization** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflows didn't initialize git submodules, which could cause build failures.

**Files Fixed**:
- `.github/workflows/test-build.yml` - Added `submodules: recursive`
- `.github/workflows/build-steamdeck-flatpak.yml` - Added `submodules: recursive`
- `scripts/build-steamdeck-flatpak.sh` - Added submodule initialization function

### 4. **Incorrect qmdnsengine Repository URL** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The Steam Deck Flatpak manifest was using the wrong qmdnsengine repository URL.

**Files Fixed**:
- `moonlight-steamdeck.yml` (Line 75)
- Changed from: `https://github.com/nitroshare/qmdnsengine.git`
- Changed to: `https://github.com/cgutman/qmdnsengine.git`

### 5. **Missing --install-deps-from Flag** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflows were missing the `--install-deps-from=flathub` flag for proper dependency installation.

**Files Fixed**:
- `.github/workflows/test-build.yml` - Added `--install-deps-from=flathub`
- `.github/workflows/build-steamdeck-flatpak.yml` - Added `--install-deps-from=flathub`

## 🚀 Build System Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- All build scripts use `set -e` for strict error handling
- Proper exit codes for failure conditions
- Comprehensive error messages and status reporting

### Submodule Management
- Added automatic submodule initialization in build script
- GitHub Actions now properly clones submodules
- Graceful handling of submodule failures

### Dependency Management
- Consistent runtime version usage across all build systems
- Proper Flatpak remote configuration
- Automatic dependency installation from Flathub

   ```

2. **Create a release build**:
   ```bash
   git tag v6.1.9-steamdeck
   git push origin v6.1.9-steamdeck
   ```

3. **Test locally** (if you have a desktop environment):
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results

With these fixes, the GitHub Actions builds should:

1. **Successfully initialize submodules** ✅
2. **Install correct runtime versions** ✅
3. **Build all dependencies properly** ✅
4. **Create working Flatpak bundles** ✅
5. **Generate proper release artifacts** ✅

## 🔍 Monitoring

To monitor the build status:
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow runs
2. Review build logs for any remaining issues
3. Test generated Flatpak bundles on Steam Deck
4. Verify all dependencies are properly resolved

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** by triggering a new build
2. **Monitor build logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Test the generated Flatpak** on Steam Deck
4. **Create a release** if everything works correctly
