# 🎉 Moonlight Steam Deck Flatpak - Build Complete!

## ✅ **What We've Built**

A complete, working Steam Deck optimized Flatpak build system for Moonlight with automated GitHub Actions builds.

## 🚀 **How to Get the Working App**

### **Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
The app is automatically built by GitHub Actions. You can find it in:

1. **GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/makeittech/moonlight-qt/releases
   - Look for `moonlight-steamdeck-*.flatpak` files
   - These are automatically created when you push tags

2. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**: 
   - Go to Actions tab in the repository
   - Click on the latest workflow run
   - Download the `moonlight-steamdeck-test` artifact

### **Option 2: Trigger a New Build**
To create a new build, simply push a tag:

```bash
git tag v6.1.2-steamdeck
git push origin v6.1.2-steamdeck
```

This will automatically:
- Build the Flatpak in GitHub Actions
- Create a new release
- Upload the `.flatpak` file

### **Option 3: Manual Build (Desktop Environment)**
If you have a proper desktop environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Build the Flatpak
make build

# Or use the script directly
./scripts/build-steamdeck-flatpak.sh
```

## 📦 **Installation on Steam Deck**

### **Via Terminal:**
```bash
flatpak install moonlight-steamdeck-*.flatpak
```

### **Via Discover App:**
1. Copy the `.flatpak` file to your Steam Deck
2. Open Discover app
3. Click "Install" on the Flatpak file

### **Add to Steam:**
1. Open Steam in Desktop Mode
2. Go to Games → Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library
3. Browse to `/usr/bin/flatpak`
4. Set launch options to: `run com.moonlight_stream.Moonlight`

## 🎮 **Steam Deck Optimizations**

The built app includes:

- **Enhanced Controller Support**: SDL environment variables for Steam Deck gamepads
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Full DRI access for smooth streaming
- **Steam Integration**: Support for Steam's virtual gamepad
- **Performance**: Optimized for Steam Deck's hardware
- **File System Access**: Full access for game saves and configurations

## 🔄 **Automated Build System**

### **GitHub Actions Workflows:**

1. **`build-steamdeck-flatpak.yml`** - Main build workflow
   - Triggers on tag pushes (creates releases)
   - Triggers on main branch pushes (testing)
   - Manual trigger support

2. **`test-build.yml`** - Test workflow
   - Triggers on branch pushes
   - Creates test artifacts
   - Validates build process

### **Build Triggers:**
- **Tag pushes** (e.g., `v6.1.1-steamdeck`) → Creates release with Flatpak
- **Branch pushes** → Runs test builds
- **Manual triggers** → Custom builds
